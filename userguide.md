# POOL User Guide
One of the greatest charatistic of POOL is that it can be as simple or as advanced as you would like it to be. The simple components of the POOL network outlined [here](https://github.com/pool-beta/pool-info/blob/master/pool.md) can be extended to a truly infinite number of cases that can outline virtually any finanical plan. In the other hand, POOL can just be used to split a meal with a friend.

## Set Up
There are only two steps to the set up:
1. Create a POOL account
    - This can be done through the POOL app or the POOL website
2. Get the POOL debit card
    - This will be automatically sent to you once you create your POOL account

Once you have done those two things, you are ready to start using POOL!
